Summary

The subgraph uses these event handlers to listen to specific events emitted by the Commit smart contract. Each handler function processes the event data and creates a corresponding entity that is stored in The Graph’s indexing service. By capturing and indexing these events, the subgraph enables efficient and powerful querying capabilities for decentralized applications (dApps) interacting with the Commit contract.

Entities Tracked:
	•	Created: Records when new events are created.
	•	Staked: Tracks when users stake tokens on events.
	•	Slashed: Logs when a user’s stake is slashed.
	•	Unstake: Records when users withdraw their stakes.

Usage:
	•	Developers can query these entities using GraphQL to fetch real-time data about events, stakes, slashes, and unstaking activities.
	•	This data can be used to display event details, user participation, and other analytics in dApps.

Note:
	•	The unique ID for each entity is generated by concatenating the transaction hash with the log index. This ensures that each entity is uniquely identifiable, even if multiple events occur within the same transaction.
